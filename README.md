Social Images is an extension for the [Contao Open Source CMS](https://contao.org).

Enable the images on your website for the social portals like Facebook or Google+. 
The images are fetched from all content elements, news and events visible on the current page. 
Beside that, you can also set a main image per website root (e.g. the company logo).

The extension is sponsored by [Empressio](http://empressio.com).
