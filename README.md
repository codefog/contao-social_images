Social Images is a bundle for the [Contao Open Source CMS](https://contao.org).

Enable the images on your website for social portals like Facebook. The images are fetched from all content elements,
news, and events visible on the current page. Besides that, you can also set the main image per website root
(e.g., the company logo).
